## Dimensions (WIP)

Another take on dimensional unit correctness based on [Scott Meyer's work](http://se.ethz.ch/~meyer/publications/OTHERS/scott_meyers/dimensions.pdf).

This project is still WIP.

Check out my [Units](https://github.com/TheAllenChou/units) project that uses a different approach.
